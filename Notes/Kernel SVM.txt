Kernel Support Vector Machine

Kernel Function is a method used to take data as input and transform it into the required form of processing data. It computes how similar
two points look after being projected into a higher feature space, without ever performing the projection.

Kernels in SVM can be used to:
    - Similarity Measurement
        Kernels calculate how closely two data points are related in feature space.
    - Dimensional Expansion
        They map data into higher dimensions implicitly without expensive computation.
    - Flexible Boundaries
        They enable the model to draw curved or irregular separation lines.
    - Efficient Computation
        They avoid manually engineering additional feature columns.
    - Inner Product Trick
        Kernels compute complex feature relationships using simple mathematical shortcuts.

Using Kernel Functions:
    - Non-Linear Patterns
        Many real-world problems cannot be separated with straight lines.
    - Smooth Separation
        Kernels allow boundaries that curve around data clusters.
    - Reduced Feature Work
        They eliminate manual creation of polynomial or cross terms.
    - Improved Accuracy
        Non-linear transformations capture deeper relationships.
    - General Adaptability
        Kernels make SVM work well across diverse data types.

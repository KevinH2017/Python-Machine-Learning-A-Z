Simpler Linear Regression

Linear regression is a machine-learning algorithm that uses labelled datasets to map the data points with the 
most optimized linear functions which can be used for predictions on new datasets. This is done only if there is a linear
relationship between the input and output, as long as the output changes at a constant rate as the input changes.
This is represented with a straight line known as the Best-Fit Line.

Simple linear regression is used when you want to predict a target value (dependent variable) using only one input feature
(independent variable) while assuming a straight-line relationship between the two.

Classification

Classification is a machine learning technique to identify the category of new observations based on
training data. The goal is to assign each data point to a predefined class, such as spam vs non-spam
or diseased vs healthy patients.

There are 3 types of classification:
    1. Binary Classification
        The simplest type of classification. The goal of which is to sort the data into two distinct categories.
        It works by looking at different features to decide which category the data point is put into.

    2. Multiclass Classification
        This sorts data into more than 2 categories. This model picks the one that best matches the input.

    3. Multi-Label Classification
        In this type of classification, a single piece of data can belong to multiple categories at once.
        Unlike in multiclass classification, datapoints can belong to multiple classes.

Classification works by training a model using a labeled dataset where each input is paired with its correct output label.
The model learns patterns and relationships in the data, so it can later predict labels for new, unseen inputs.
    1. Data Collection
        Start with a dataset where each item is labeled with the correct class.
    
    2. Feature Extraction
        The system identifies features like color, shape or texture that help distuingish one class from another. These
        features are what the model uses ot make predictions.

    3. Model Training
        Classification algorithm using the labeled data to learn how to map the features to the correct class.
        It looks for patterns and relationships in the data.

    4. Model Evaluation
        Once the model is trained, it is tested on new, unseen data to check how accurately it can classify the items.

    5. Prediction
        After being trained and evaluated, the model can be used to predict the class of new data based on the features
        it has learned.

    6. Model Evaluation
        Evaluating a classification model is a key step in machine learning. It helps us check how well the model performs
        and how good it is at handling new, unseen data. Depending on the problem and needs it can use different metrics
        to measure its performance.

If the quality metric is not satisfactory, the machine learning algorithm or hyperparameters can be ajusted and the model is
retrained. This iterative process continues until a satisfactory performance is achieved.

Classification Algorithms:

    Linear Classifiers:
        Linear classifier models create a linear decision boundary between classes. They are simple and computationally efficient.
        Types:
            Logistic Regression
            Support Vector Machines having kernel = 'linear'
            Single-layer Perceptron
            Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier


    Non-linear Classifiers:
        Non-linear models create a non-linear decision boundary between classes. They can capture more complex relationships 
        between input features and target variable.
        Types:
            K-Nearest Neighbours
            Kernel SVM
            Naive Bayes
            Decision Tree Classification
            Ensemble learning classifiers: 
            Random Forests, 
            AdaBoost, 
            Bagging Classifier, 
            Voting Classifier, 
            Extra Trees Classifier
            Multi-layer Artificial Neural Networks

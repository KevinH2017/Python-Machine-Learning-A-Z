Hierarchical Clusters

Hierarchical clutering is a method that groups data into a hierarchy of clusters based on similarity.
Building a tree-like structure that helps visualize relationships and decide the optimal number of clusters.
It does not require pre-selecting the number of clusters.
Uses agglomerative or divisive approaches.
Commonly applied in data exploration and pattern discovery.
It is commonly used in pattern recognition, customer segmentation, and image grouping.

There are 2 types of Hierarchical Clustering:
    1. Agglomerative Clustering:
        - Bottom up approach where it treats each data as a singleton cluster at the outset and then successively agglomerates pairs of
        clusters until all clusters have been merged into a single cluster that contains all data.

    2. Divisive Clustering:
        - Top down approach which requires a method for splitting a cluster that contains the whole data and proceeds by splitting clusters
        recursively until individual data have been split into singleton clusters.

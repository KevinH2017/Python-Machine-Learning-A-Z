Feature Scaling in Data Preprocessing

Feature scaling is important in preprocessing datasets for machine learning because it helps machine learning algorithms use
distance-based calculations to make predictions. If features are not scaled properly, larger values can have a disproportionate
affect on the results. Feature scaling can also help improve the convergence speed and performance of some optimization algorithms.
It can also help in handling skewed data and outliers, which also can influence the model's behavior and end results.

Feature scaling helps enhance the performance of machine learning models. Scaling the features helps make it easier for algorithms to
find the optimal solution, as the different scales of the features do not influence the results. This is effective in algorithms like
k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks.

Skewed data and outliers help handle these cases by transforming the data into a standardized range, reducing the impact of extreme
values and makes the model more robust. This makes it very beneficial for algorithms that assume a normal distribution and are sensitive
to outliers, such as linear regression.

Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together into clusers based on
their characteristics, without using any labeled data. The objective is to ensure that data points within the same
cluster are more similar to each other than to those in different clusters, enabling the discovery of natural
groupings and hidden patterns in complex datasets.
The goal is to discover the natural grouping or structure in unlabeled data without predefined categories.
How this is done is by assigning data points to clusters based on their similarity or distance measures.
Similarity measures can include Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, or other metrics depending on data
type and clustering method.
The output is that each group is assigned a cluster ID, representing shared characteristics within the cluster.

Types of Clustering:
    Hard Clustering:
        In hard clustering, each data point strictly belongs to exactly one cluster, no overlap allowed. This
        approach assigns a clear membership, making it easier to interpret and use for definitive segmentation tasks.
        Use Cases: 
            Market segmentation, customer grouping, document clustering.
        Limitations: 
            Cannot represent ambiguity or overlap between groups; boundaries are crisp.

    Soft Clustering:
        Soft clustering assigns each data point a probability or degree of membership to multiple clusters simultaneously,
        allowing data points to partially belong to several groups.
        Use Cases:
            Situations with overlapping class boundaries, fuzzy categories like customer personas or medical diagnosis.
        Benefits:
            Captures ambiguity in data, models gradual transitions between clusters.

    K-Means Clustering:
        K-Means Clustering groups similar data points into clusters without needing labeled data. It is used to uncover hidden patterns when the goal is to organize data based on similarity.
        Advantages:
            Helps identify natural groupings in unlabeled datasets
            Works by grouping points based on distance to cluster centers
            Commonly used in customer segmentation, image compression, and pattern discovery
            Useful when you need structure from raw, unorganized data

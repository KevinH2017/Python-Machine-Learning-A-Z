The Machine Learning Process

1.) Data Pre-Processing
    - Import the data
    - Clean the data
    - Split into training and test sets

2.) Modelling
    - Build the model
    - Train the model
    - Make predictions

3.) Evaluation
    - Calculate performance metrics
    - Make a verdict

Training Set and Test Set

Training and Test sets are data used to make models and determine their accuracy.

Feature Scaling

Feature Scaling are columns and processing them, there are 2 kinds Normalization and Standardization.
Normalization is scaling the information in a column to be either 0 or 1.
Standardization is scaling the information to be between -3 and 3

Apriori Algorithm

Apriori algorithm is a method used in data analysis to find groups of items that often appear together in large sets of
data. It helps to discover useful patterns or rules about how items are related which is particularly useful in markey
basket analysis. 

The Apriori algorithm works through a systemic process that involves several steps:
    1. Identifying Frequent Item-Sets:
        - The algorithm starts by looking through all the data to count how many times each single item appears.
        These items are called 1-Item-Sets.
        - Next it uses a rule called minimum support this is a number that tells us how often an item or group
        of items need to appear to be important. If an item appears often enough meaning its count is above the
        minimum support it is called a frequent Item-Set.

    2. Creating Possible Item Group:
        - After finding the single items that appear often enough (frequent 1-item groups) the algorithm combines
        them to create pairs of items (2-item groups). Then it checks which pairs are frequent by seeing if the
        appear enough times in the data.
        - This process repeats step by step making groups of 3 times, then 4 items and so on. The algorithm stops
        when it can't find any bigger groups that happen often enough.

    3. Removing Infrequent Item Groups:
        - The algorithm uses a rule to save time. If a group of items does not appear often enough then any larger
        group that includes these items it will not appear often.
        - The algorithm does not check those larger groups. This way it avoids wasting time looking at groups
        that won't be important to make the whole process faster.

    4. Generating Association Rules:
        - The algorithm makes rules to show how the items are related.
        - It checks these rules using support, confidence and lift to find the strongest ones.

The key metrics of Apriori Algorithm are:
    - Support:
        This metric measures how frequently an item appears in the dataset relative to the total number of transactions.
        A higher support indicates a more significant presence of the Item-Set in the dataset. It tells us how often
        a particular item or combination of items appears in all the transactions.

    - Confidence:
        This assesses the likelihood that an item Y is purchased when item X is purchased. It provides insight into the
        strength of the association between two items. Confidence tells us how often items go together.

    - Lift:
        Lift evaluates how much more likely two items are to be purchased together compared to being purchased independently.
        A lift greater that 1 suggests a strong positive association. Lift also shows how strong the connection is between
        items.
